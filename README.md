# *Face Classification based on Python*

## *Background*

*This is the summer semester homework for THU EE freshman in 2021.8, the purpose of which, interpreted by the consoulors, is to get familiar with the basic grammar of Python. 
Therefore, the accuracy of the classification is not what to be concerned with and all methods and algorithms, no matter how basic or advanced they might be, are encouraged.*
